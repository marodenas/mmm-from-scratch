    "# 00 — Problem Context and Modeling Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Build a Marketing Mix Model (MMM) **from scratch** in order to fully understand its assumptions, implications, and limitations, and later compare it with established frameworks (e.g. Robyn, Meridian).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is not immediate optimization, but **deep understanding of the model and the decisions it introduces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Question\n",
    "This model aims to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the incremental impact of each marketing channel on weekly purchases (conversions) over time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended Business Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "This MMM is intended to support:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strategic budget allocation across channels**  \n",
    "  (how much to invest in each channel over a medium-to-long-term horizon)\n",
    "- **Scenario analysis**  \n",
    "  (what happens if spend is increased or decreased in specific channels)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Justification (intended use, not validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the final model fit quality, MMMs are designed to support **strategic and portfolio-level decisions**, as they operate on aggregated time-series data and estimate average effects over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By construction, this type of model **is not suitable for short-term operational decisions**, such as:\n",
    "- daily bidding,\n",
    "- creative optimization,\n",
    "- user- or campaign-level attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Model Is NOT Expected to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is **not intended to**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict the KPI accurately on a week-by-week basis.\n",
    "- Capture short-term shocks or exceptional events.\n",
    "- Provide causal attribution at the individual level.\n",
    "- Replace experiments or incremental lift tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of MMM lies in explaining **structural and average incremental drivers**, not in operational forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## KPI and Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target\n",
    "Use **ALL_PURCHASES** as the main KPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metric: number of purchases\n",
    "- Frequency: weekly\n",
    "- Aggregation: sum\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Channels\n",
    "**Paid media spend** will be used as the primary marketing input, aggregated weekly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spend is the standard MMM input because:\n",
    "- it is directly linked to budget decisions,\n",
    "- it represents a controllable business lever,\n",
    "- it avoids introducing intermediate metrics at early modeling stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Control Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Control variables represent factors not directly controlled by marketing that may influence the KPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Included from the start**\n",
    "- Trend (time index)\n",
    "- Seasonality (recurring weekly / yearly patterns)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential (not initially included)**\n",
    "- Promotions or discount periods\n",
    "- Price changes\n",
    "- Product launches\n",
    "- Relevant external events / holidays\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Initially Excluded\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clicks and impressions (kept for later exploratory analysis)\n",
    "- Organic and direct traffic as “channels”  \n",
    "  (they may be introduced later as control variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Modeling Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Persistence of Effects (Adstock)\n",
    "Marketing investments may have effects that persist over time and influence future purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without adstock, upper-funnel channels tend to be undervalued.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diminishing Returns (Saturation)\n",
    "The marginal impact of spend decreases as investment increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without saturation, the model may recommend unrealistic allocations, such as allocating the entire budget to a single channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximately Linear Relationship After Transformations\n",
    "After applying adstock and saturation, a linear relationship is assumed to approximate the KPI response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach:\n",
    "- preserves interpretability,\n",
    "- captures core MMM dynamics,\n",
    "- avoids unnecessary complexity in early stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observational, Correlation-Based Model\n",
    "The MMM estimates **associations**, not true causal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model supports strategic decision-making, but **does not prove causality** without additional evidence (e.g. experiments or lift tests).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Stability Within the Modeling Window\n",
    "Effects are assumed to be approximately stable over the analyzed period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major structural changes (algorithms, pricing, product, channel mix) may cause a single average effect to be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risks and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Omitted Variable Bias\n",
    "Unobserved factors (promotions, pricing, PR, stock-outs) may bias attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multicollinearity\n",
    "Channels may move together, making it difficult to reliably disentangle their individual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Misspecification Risk\n",
    "Incorrect choices of:\n",
    "- adstock parameters,\n",
    "- saturation functions,\n",
    "\n",
    "may distort estimated contributions and scenario recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-Term Shocks\n",
    "Sudden events may create spikes or drops not explained by the model and affect coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity to Time Window and Validation\n",
    "Results may vary depending on:\n",
    "- the selected time period,\n",
    "- the temporal validation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The MMM will not be evaluated solely on fit metrics, but also on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coefficient stability over time\n",
    "- Sign and magnitude coherence\n",
    "- Out-of-sample temporal behavior\n",
    "- Ability to separate structural baseline from incremental impact\n",
    "- Interpretability and economic plausibility\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Incremental Modeling Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling approach is intentionally incremental to maintain control over assumptions and enable diagnosis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Baseline linear regression (sanity checks)\n",
    "2. Adstock (carryover effects)\n",
    "3. Saturation (diminishing returns)\n",
    "4. Regularization (Ridge) for coefficient stability\n",
    "5. Time controls (trend and seasonality)\n",
    "6. Temporal validation and diagnostics\n",
    "7. Interpretation, limitations, and next steps\n",
    "8. (Optional) semi-parametric models (e.g. GAM) and/or Bayesian formulation to quantify uncertainty\n"
