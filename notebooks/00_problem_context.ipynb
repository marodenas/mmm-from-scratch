    "# 00 — Problem context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Define the business question, target metric, channels, and modeling scope for a Marketing Mix Model (MMM) built from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business question\n",
    "What is the incremental impact of each marketing channel on the business KPI over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intended decision\n",
    "Support marketing budget allocation and channel prioritization decisions by understanding which channels contribute most to the target KPI and how their impact evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is intended for:\n",
    "- high-level budget reallocation\n",
    "- scenario analysis (increase/decrease spend by channel)\n",
    "- strategic discussions, not operational optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target (KPI)\n",
    "- Name: Sales (or Conversions / Revenue)\n",
    "- Definition: Total business outcome generated in a given time period.\n",
    "- Unit: Monetary units (e.g. €) or number of conversions.\n",
    "- Granularity: Weekly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channels (initial)\n",
    "The initial set of marketing channels considered in the model:\n",
    "- Paid Search\n",
    "- Paid Social\n",
    "- Display\n",
    "- Offline / TV\n",
    "- Affiliates\n",
    "\n",
    "(Channels are limited to a small set to prioritize interpretability.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential control variables\n",
    "Variables not directly controlled by marketing but that may influence the KPI:\n",
    "- Time trend (business growth or decline)\n",
    "- Seasonality (weekly / yearly patterns)\n",
    "- Promotions or special campaigns\n",
    "- Price changes\n",
    "- Major external events (e.g. holidays, product launches)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions (initial)\n",
    "- Marketing effects may persist over time (carryover effects).\n",
    "- Returns may diminish as spend increases (saturation).\n",
    "- The relationship between spend and outcome can be approximated linearly after transformations.\n",
    "- The model captures correlations, not true causal effects.\n",
    "- Effects are assumed to be stable within the modeling window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risks & limitations\n",
    "- Omitted variable bias due to unobserved factors.\n",
    "- Multicollinearity between channels.\n",
    "- Incorrect functional form (adstock/saturation misspecification).\n",
    "- Limited ability to capture short-term shocks.\n",
    "- Results may be sensitive to time window and validation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Done\n",
    "- KPI, channels, and scope clearly defined.\n",
    "- Intended business decision explicitly stated.\n",
    "- Initial assumptions and limitations written down.\n",
    "- Base modeling table schema sketched.\n"
