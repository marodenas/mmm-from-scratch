    "# 00 — Problem context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Define the business question, target KPI, channels, scope, and assumptions for a Marketing Mix Model (MMM) built from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business question\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "What is the incremental impact of each marketing channel on weekly purchases (conversions) over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intended decision (what this model will be used for)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision\n",
    "Use this MMM to guide **cross-channel budget allocation** (how much to invest in each channel) and to run **scenario analysis** (what happens if spend changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rationale\n",
    "MMM works best for **strategic / portfolio-level** decisions because it uses aggregated time series data and estimates *average* effects over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Low-level allocation (within-channel)\n",
    "This project aims to eventually support **low-level allocation** (e.g. within Paid Search or Paid Social), but that requires an additional layer beyond MMM:\n",
    "- experimentation (geo-lift / incrementality tests) where possible\n",
    "- within-channel models or rules (campaign/creative segmentation)\n",
    "- operational constraints (pacing, min/max spend)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the initial MMM is treated as a **top-down allocator** across channels, not a daily campaign optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target (KPI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision\n",
    "Use **ALL_PURCHASES** as the primary KPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Total number of purchases completed in a given time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unit: count (purchases)\n",
    "- Raw granularity: daily\n",
    "- Modeling granularity: weekly (daily aggregated to weekly)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "- Purchase counts are stable and interpretable for MMM learning.\n",
    "- Revenue-based KPIs can be explored later once the modeling pipeline is stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What would change my mind\n",
    "- If order value varies strongly due to promotions/pricing changes, a revenue KPI may be preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channels (initial)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision\n",
    "Use **paid media spend** as marketing inputs (baseline MMM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Channels available in the dataset:\n",
    "- GOOGLE_PAID_SEARCH_SPEND\n",
    "- GOOGLE_SHOPPING_SPEND\n",
    "- GOOGLE_PMAX_SPEND\n",
    "- GOOGLE_DISPLAY_SPEND\n",
    "- GOOGLE_VIDEO_SPEND\n",
    "- META_FACEBOOK_SPEND\n",
    "- META_INSTAGRAM_SPEND\n",
    "- META_OTHER_SPEND\n",
    "- TIKTOK_SPEND\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "Spend is the standard MMM input and provides the cleanest baseline for incremental impact estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we will exclude initially\n",
    "- Clicks and impressions (kept for later exploration)\n",
    "- Organic/direct click metrics as “channels” (may be used as controls later)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential control variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Controls represent non-marketing drivers of the KPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum set (always included)\n",
    "- Trend (time index)\n",
    "- Seasonality (week-of-year / month)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional (if available)\n",
    "- Promotions / discount periods\n",
    "- Pricing changes\n",
    "- Product launches\n",
    "- Major external events / holidays\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "Controls reduce the risk of attributing non-marketing variation to marketing channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions (initial)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Carryover effects (adstock)\n",
    "**Assumption:** Marketing effects can persist over time.\n",
    "- Spend this week may affect purchases in future weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Without carryover, upper-funnel channels may be undervalued.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Diminishing returns (saturation)\n",
    "**Assumption:** Returns diminish as spend increases.\n",
    "- Extra spend has decreasing marginal impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Without saturation, the model may recommend unrealistic “put everything in one channel” allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Linear relationship after transformations\n",
    "**Assumption:** After applying adstock and saturation, a linear model can approximate the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** It keeps the baseline interpretable while capturing core MMM dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Observational (correlation-based)\n",
    "**Assumption:** The model estimates associations, not true causal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** MMM supports decisions but does not prove causal impact without additional evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Parameter stability in the modeling window\n",
    "**Assumption:** Effects are roughly stable over the modeled period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** If effects change drastically (algorithm/product/pricing changes), a single average effect can mislead.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risks & limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Omitted variables bias\n",
    "Unobserved factors (promotions, pricing, PR, stockouts) may bias attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multicollinearity\n",
    "Channels may move together, making it difficult to separate their effects reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Misspecification risk\n",
    "Wrong adstock/saturation choices can distort channel contributions and scenario recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term shocks\n",
    "Sudden events can create unexplained spikes/drops and mislead coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity to time window and validation strategy\n",
    "Model results can change depending on the selected time period and holdout approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Done\n",
    "- KPI, channels, and scope clearly defined\n",
    "- Intended decisions (high-level and low-level roadmap) explicitly stated\n",
    "- Assumptions and limitations written explicitly\n",
    "- Base modeling table schema sketched\n",
