# Writing backlog

## Post ideas
- Why build an MMM from scratch (and what it cannot do)
- Correlation traps in MMM: why “obvious” results are suspicious
- Adstock explained with a simple experiment
- Saturation: diminishing returns or model artifact?
- Temporal validation: how MMMs lie when you validate wrong
- How to break your own MMM (sensitivity checks)

## Rules
- One post = one strong idea
- Always include assumptions + limitations
- Link to the notebook that generated the key figure
