# mmm-from-scratch
Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) project built from scratch to understand assumptions, limitations, and trade-offs behind marketing attribution. Starts with a simple baseline MMM and evolves through incremental improvements and comparisons with established frameworks (e.g. Robyn, Meridian), focusing on learning and decision-making, not automation.
